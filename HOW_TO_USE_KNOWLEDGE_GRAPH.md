# How to Use the Knowledge Graph

## Quick Start

The Knowledge Graph helps you visualize the connections between your notes. Here's how to use it:

## Opening the Knowledge Graph

### Step 1: Open the Unified Panel
Press `⌘\` (Mac) or `Ctrl+\` (Windows/Linux) to open the menu panel.

**OR**

Click the menu button (☰) in the top-right corner of the screen.

### Step 2: Find the Network Button
In the panel that opens, look for the purple "Knowledge Graph" button with a network icon (◇).

### Step 3: Click to Open
Click the purple "Knowledge Graph" button. The modal will open showing your notes as a graph.

## Understanding the Visualization

### Nodes (Circles)
Each circle represents one note:
- **Blue circles** = Text notes
- **Purple circles** = Drawing notes
- **Green circles** = Mindmap notes
- **Yellow circles** = Your current note

### Node Sizes
- **Larger circles** = More connections to other notes
- **Smaller circles** = Fewer connections

### Connections (Lines with Arrows)
- **Lines** connect notes that link to each other
- **Arrows** show the direction (which note links to which)
- More lines = more interconnected notes

## Interacting with the Graph

### Navigation
- **Click on any node** to open that note
- **Scroll wheel** to zoom in/out
- **Click and drag** on empty space to pan around
- **Click "Reset View"** button to return to default view

### Filtering
- **Use the folder dropdown** at the top to filter notes by folder
  - "All Notes" shows your entire workspace
  - "Root Folder" shows notes not in any folder
  - Select a folder to see notes in that folder and subfolders

### Controls
Three buttons in the bottom-right corner:
- **Zoom In** (+) - Get closer to nodes
- **Zoom Out** (-) - See more of the graph
- **Reset View** (⊡) - Return to default zoom and position

## Legend

In the bottom-left corner, you'll see:
- **Current Note** - Yellow circle with orange border
- **Text Note** - Blue circle
- **Drawing Note** - Purple circle
- **Mindmap Note** - Green circle

Plus additional info:
- "Larger nodes = more connections"
- "Drag to pan · Scroll to zoom · Click to open"

## Statistics

At the top of the modal, you'll see:
- **X notes** - Total number of notes shown
- **X links** - Total number of connections
- **X connected** - Notes that have at least one connection

## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Create Note Links First
The graph shows connections created with the `/note-link` command in your notes.

To create a link:
1. Open a note
2. Type `/note-link`
3. Select a note to link to
4. The graph will show this connection

### 2. Build a Connected Network
- Link related concepts together
- Create "hub" notes that connect many topics
- Use folders to organize by project or theme

### 3. Use Folder Filtering
- Start with "All Notes" to see the big picture
- Filter by folder to focus on specific projects
- Use "Root Folder" to see your main notes

### 4. Explore Regularly
- Open the graph when starting work
- Find notes you haven't visited recently
- Discover connections you forgot about
- Navigate between notes visually

### 5. Find Important Notes
- Look for large nodes (many connections)
- These are often central concepts
- They might be good starting points for your work

### 6. Find Isolated Notes
- Small nodes on the edges are less connected
- Consider linking them to the main graph
- They might be ideas that need development

## Common Use Cases

### Personal Knowledge Management
1. Create notes on different topics
2. Link related concepts
3. Use graph to see connections
4. Discover knowledge clusters

### Project Planning
1. Create notes for tasks and docs
2. Link dependencies
3. Visualize project structure
4. Track related work items

### Research and Study
1. Take notes on sources
2. Link related findings
3. See citation patterns
4. Find research gaps

### Writing and Content
1. Create notes for ideas
2. Link related themes
3. Find content clusters
4. Plan article structure

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **⌘\ or Ctrl+\** - Open/close the unified panel
- **ESC** - Close the knowledge graph modal
- **Mouse wheel** - Zoom in/out

## Troubleshooting

### "No notes found"
- Make sure you have created at least one note
- Check that you're not filtering to an empty folder

### "Loading all notes..."
- Wait for the graph to load
- Large workspaces may take a few seconds

### Graph looks empty
- Create note links using `/note-link` command
- Notes without links will appear but won't have connections

### Can't find the button
- Press `⌘\` to open the unified panel
- Look in the Browse tab
- The button has a purple gradient background

### Graph is too zoomed in/out
- Use the zoom buttons in the bottom-right
- Or use your mouse wheel to zoom
- Click "Reset View" to return to default
