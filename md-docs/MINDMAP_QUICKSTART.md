# Mindmap Notes - Quick Start Guide

Get started with mindmap notes in under 2 minutes!

## What is a Mindmap Note?

A mindmap note is a visual way to organize ideas. It starts with a central concept and branches out into related ideas, creating a tree-like structure that's perfect for:
- Brainstorming sessions
- Project planning
- Learning and study notes
- Concept mapping
- Decision making

## Creating Your First Mindmap

### Step 1: Create a New Mindmap Note
1. Open the sidebar (click the menu icon on the left)
2. Click the green **"New Mindmap"** button
3. A new mindmap opens with a "Central Idea" node

### Step 2: Edit the Central Node
1. **Double-click** the "Central Idea" node
2. Type your main topic (e.g., "Project Planning")
3. Press **Enter** to save

### Step 3: Add Your First Branch
1. **Click** the central node to select it (it will highlight)
2. Click the **+ button** in the toolbar on the left
3. A new child node appears
4. **Double-click** the new node to edit its text
5. Type your idea (e.g., "Timeline")
6. Press **Enter**

### Step 4: Build Your Mindmap
Repeat Step 3 to add more branches:
- Select a node (click it)
- Add child (+ button)
- Edit text (double-click)
- Repeat!

### Step 5: Organize Your Ideas
- **Drag nodes** to reposition them for better layout
- **Collapse branches** by selecting a node and clicking the collapse button (−)
- **Pan the view** by holding Shift/Cmd and dragging
- **Zoom** using your mouse wheel

### Step 6: Save Your Work
1. Enter a title at the top (e.g., "My Project Plan")
2. Click **Save** or press **Cmd/Ctrl + S**
3. Your mindmap is automatically saved to the cloud!

## Essential Controls

## Pro Tips

### 🎯 Keep it Simple
- Use short, clear labels (2-5 words per node)
- Don't overcrowd one branch with too many children
- Break complex ideas into multiple levels

### 🎨 Use Visual Organization
- Colors are automatically assigned to help distinguish branches
- Position related concepts near each other
- Use collapse to focus on one area at a time

### 💾 Save Often
- Mindmaps auto-save when you click Save
- Use **Cmd/Ctrl + S** to save quickly
- Changes are saved in real-time to Supabase

### 🔍 Navigate Large Mindmaps
- Use the **Fit to View** button to see everything
- Collapse branches you're not working on
- Zoom in to focus on specific areas

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I change node colors?**
A: Colors are automatically assigned based on the node's position. Custom colors coming soon!

**Q: How do I delete the central node?**
A: You can't delete the root node, but you can edit its text to change the central idea.

**Q: Can I add multiple root nodes?**
A: Currently, each mindmap has one central node. You can create separate mindmaps for different topics.

**Q: What's the limit on nodes?**
A: There's no hard limit, but for best performance, keep mindmaps under 100 nodes. For larger projects, break into multiple mindmaps.

**Q: Can I export my mindmap?**
A: Export features are coming soon! Currently, mindmaps are saved as JSON in your database.

## Next Steps

Now that you've created your first mindmap:
1. Try creating mindmaps for different purposes
2. Experiment with organizing nodes in different layouts
3. Use the collapse feature to manage complex mindmaps
4. Combine mindmaps with rich-text notes for complete documentation

Happy mapping! 🗺️✨
