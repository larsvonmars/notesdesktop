# Knowledge Graph Quick Start

## What is the Knowledge Graph?

The Knowledge Graph visualizes your notes and their connections, helping you understand the relationships between different notes in your workspace.

## Quick Start

### 1. Create Some Note Links

First, create connections between your notes:

```
1. Open a note
2. Type /note-link
3. Select a note to link to
4. Repeat in other notes to build connections
```

### 2. Open the Knowledge Graph

**From the Unified Panel:**
1. Click the menu button (⌘\\) in the top-right
2. In the Browse tab, find the "Knowledge Graph" button
3. Click it to open the visualization

### 3. Explore Your Notes

- **Filter**: Use the folder dropdown to focus on specific folders
- **Zoom**: Scroll to zoom in/out
- **Pan**: Drag the background to move around
- **Navigate**: Click any node to open that note
- **Reset**: Click "Reset View" to center the graph

## Understanding the Graph

### Folder Filter
- **All Notes**: See your entire knowledge base
- **Root Folder**: Only notes not in any folder
- **Specific Folder**: Notes in that folder and subfolders

### Node Sizes
- **Larger nodes** = More connections
- **Smaller nodes** = Fewer connections

### Node Colors
- 🔵 **Blue** = Text notes
- 🟣 **Purple** = Drawing notes  
- 🟢 **Green** = Mindmap notes

### Current Note
- Your currently open note has a **yellow background with orange border**

### Connections
- **Lines** show links between notes
- **Arrows** point from the source note to the linked note
- The direction shows which note links to which

## Tips

1. **Build connections** by using /note-link in your notes
2. **Filter by folder** to focus on specific projects or topics
3. **Use "All Notes"** to see the big picture across your entire workspace
4. **Find hubs** - notes with many connections are often important
5. **Discover isolated notes** - small nodes on the edges might need more connections
6. **Navigate quickly** - click nodes instead of searching

## Example Use Cases

### Personal Knowledge Base
- Link related concepts
- See which topics are connected
- Find gaps in your knowledge

### Project Management
- Link tasks and documentation
- Visualize project dependencies
- Track related work items

### Research Notes
- Connect sources and findings
- See citation patterns
- Find related research

## Keyboard Shortcuts

When Knowledge Graph button is visible:
- **Click button** to open graph
- **ESC** to close modal (when open)
- **Click node** to navigate

## What's Next?

1. Create more note links using `/note-link`
2. Explore the graph regularly to understand your notes
3. Look for patterns and clusters
4. Connect isolated notes to the main graph

Happy exploring! 🎉
