# Note Link Quick Start Guide

## What is it?

A feature that lets you create clickable links to other notes in your workspace, similar to Wikipedia or Notion's internal links.

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a Link

While editing a note:
1. Type `/` to open commands
2. Type `note` or select "Note Link"
3. Search for and select a note
4. Done! A blue badge appears with the note link

### 2. Click a Link

Simply click on any note link badge to open that note.

### 3. Visual Example

```
Before: "Check out the meeting notes"
After:  "Check out the 📝 [Meeting Notes] ← clickable blue badge
```

## Slash Command

**Command**: `/note-link`

**Keywords**: note, link, reference, internal, wiki

**Description**: Link to another note

## Use Cases

✅ Link to related research notes  
✅ Reference meeting notes in project docs  
✅ Create a table of contents note with links  
✅ Build a personal knowledge base  
✅ Connect ideas across different notes  

## Tips

- Links show the note title, even if you rename the note later
- You can't link to the note you're currently editing
- Use search in the selector to quickly find notes
- Links work in all rich-text notes (not in drawing/mindmap notes)

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Slash menu**: `/` then type `note`
- **Select**: Enter or Tab
- **Cancel**: Escape

## What's Next?

This is just the beginning! Future versions may include:
- Backlinks (see which notes link to the current one)
- Link preview on hover
- Autocomplete with `[[Note Title]]` syntax
- Visual graph of linked notes
